A WebExtension (Firefox for the moment) to get back what I missed on Evernote and more...

## Description

Injecting some HTML/CSS/JS to get back to missed functionnalities from evernote and more

* A sidebar with bookmarks (editables, stored on localstorage)
* "Compact mode" (Css modifications to enlarge the writing zone, reducing the text font size and line height)
* A functionnality to encrypt/decrypt some parts of the note
* A functionnality to correct/give insights on text (spellchecking, sentiment analysis) 
* A pomodoro timer with sounds and counts of pomodoros (stored on localstorage)
* ... experimenting with other small things that could improve the productivity
